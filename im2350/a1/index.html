                <h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
                <div>
                    The first thing I paid attention to when visiting the website, were two things close to eachother actually. 
                    The first thing was the 'explore me' button. The 'explore me' button tried to grab my attention by its movement, 
                    so I know how to further explore the portfolio. In addition, the three dots underneath the 'explore me' button grabbed my attention.
                    This is because I have prior experiences with these three dots, for example, Snapchat uses this to provide more options to its users. 
                    Therefore, my brain was triggered and thought it would show more content.
                    So, the use of movement and knowledge through prior experiences tend to grab my attention.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
                <div>
                    <ol>
                        <li>I open the link and am presented to the website's content.</li>
                        <li>I see movement on the page as the 'explore me' button shakes and decide to go over it with my cursor.</li>
                        <li>The three dots underneath the 'explore me' button grab my attention and I move my cursor to it and try to click it. However nothing happens.</li>
                        <li>I try to scroll down, following the red line, which I thought indicated to scroll down, however nothing is there.</li>
                        <li>I am scrolling over the other elements on this page, to explore if there are any hidden affordances.</li>
                        <li>I scroll over the profile picture and notice that it moves. Because of the round shape I assume I can also click on it and try this. Nothing happens.</li>
                        <li>I decide to click on the ‘Explore Me’ button and am presented to a menu with four options.</li>
                        <li>I read and scroll over the different options.</li>
                        <li>I click on the ‘Portfolio’ button and am presented to a page with different projects.</li>
                        <li>I scroll through the different projects and notice that they move.</li>
                        <Li>I scroll back to the beginning of the page and click on one of the red buttons named 'ASP.NET'. I notice that this removes the projects from this catergorie from the list.</Li>
                        <li>I decide to click on the 'Angular' button as well.</li>
                        <li>Scrolling through the list of the remaining projects, I see 'Social Diary' and click on it.</li>
                        <li>I scroll through the project information and click on the project link. It opens in a new tab.</li>
                        <li>I look at the page and decide to click on the cross to leave the page and go back to the portfolio website.</li>
                        <li>I click the red cross in the higher left corner and go back to the projects. </li>
                        <li>I click the 'Node.js' option <i>'on'</i> again.</li>
                        <li>Clicking on the red arrow in the upper left corner and I am going back to the homepage.</li>
                        <li>I click on the ‘About & Skills’ button and scroll down, read it and scroll up on this page</li>
                        <li>I click on the red arrow in the upper left corner to go back to the homepage.</li>
                        <li>I am triggered by the 'explore me' button again and click on it.</li>
                        <li>I click on the ‘profile card’ button and am presented to a difital profile card. This profile card also has the shaking 'explore me' button and is again the first thing that grabs my attention.</li>
                        <li>I read the profile card and notice hidden movements as I scroll over the page. </li>
                        <li>I click the ‘Explore Me’ button and am back at the homepage.</li>
                        
                    </ol>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
                <div>
                    The part of the experience I spend the most time with would be the profile picture. 
                    As this is on multiple pages and has movement in it I scrolled over it with my cursor 
                    everytime to see if it would <i>'flip'</i> everytime, which it did. I also tried clicking it,
                    because it has a round shape and I assume round shapes with buttons, which I click. However,
                    nothing happened as I clicked it. 
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
                <div>
                    The action I performed most would be clicking on the different buttons and elements. 
                    There were a lot of buttons to explore <i>more</i>, and sometimes <i>less</I>, options. Additionally,
                    I would say that I moved my cursor quite a lot to explore the page. 
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
                <div>I think that the primary goal of the interactive experience is to exhibit his work and 
                    the skills that he has, in order to perhaps get a job. As employers may visit his website
                    and can see what he has to offer to them and they can easily contact him through his 'profiles' page.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
                <div>The interactive experience communicates its primary goal by stimulating 
                    the visitors to explore his skills. He does this by using movement on the 
                    'explore me' button. Also, by stating 'portfolio' and 'profiles 'clearly 
                    and multiple times, it is obvious that he wants to show his work and be contacted.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
                <div>My impression on how the experience should be interacted with overtime is as:
                    <div>First the shaking 'explore me' button should be interacted with. The menu that follows when clicking on the 'explore me' button 
                        should be explored. First click on 'about & skills' to get to know this person and after that go to the 'portfolio' page to see what 
                        this person has to offer and his previous work. This page would be the most important and also the most time consuming I think. After 
                        that people could choose to contact this person for either questions or even to hire him or explore his social media platforms to get 
                        to know him even better, which can be done through the 'profiles' page. I believe that when someone returns to his website, they would 
                        engage again with the 'portfolio' page, as this would be updated when he has more experience over time and is the main reason to visit 
                        his portfolio website.</div>

                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
                <div>It is fairly clear how it communicates to be interacted with. Namely, the 'explore me' button 
                    that shakes to grab your attention. By grabbing your attention you are most likely to click on 
                    it as well. The multiple mentions of 'portfolio' (in the menu above and the menu which appears 
                    when you click the 'explore me' button) is also a good way to direct people to the most important 
                    content of your website, as this is the main thing he wants to show. 

                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
                <div>
                    The experience references clearly: his portfolio, in which you can see different 
                    projects and additional skills. As well as who he his, what he has done and how he can 
                    be contacted.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
                <div>There are different elements that communicate how to act when engaging with the research experience. These elements can be found mainly on the 
                    homepage. Different elements are displayed that make this portfolio personally. These elements are his current status as 'student, 
                    developer and contributor', a quote with his aim, a profile picture to create a connection, a menu at the top to know what you 
                    can expect from this site, as well as the 'explore me' button to further engage with the site. 

                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
                <div>This reference communicates how should feel when engaging with it, through the use of movement in the 'explore me' button. 
                    This makes me feel curious to see what futher to explore. However, the formatting also gives off a certain feel. It seems as 
                    the website is build as a professional portfolio, rather than an educational portfolio. Meaning that the target audience is 
                    either employers or individuals looking for help is his area of expertise. 
                    By using this curiousity, his target audience wants to know more. Using the 'explore me' button, visitors are relieved by getting 
                    them excited with his work and skills. If they are excited enough to contact him, they could contact him and thus be convinced of 
                    his work, meeting their requirements and needs.
                    
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
                <div>The most frustrating part of the interaction for me was visuals leading to nothing. With this I mean 
                    that through prior experiences I would assume something would happen, when it did not. I have three examples 
                    for this on the hompage:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The round shape and border of the profile picture</li>
                        <li>The three dots underneath the 'explore me' button</li>
                        <li>The vertical red line underneath the three dots</li>
                    </ul>
                    Using different shapes like circles and lines with actions can be misleading, 
                    as I and more people have prior experiences with assuming circles are buttons 
                    which can be clicked as well as following lines to reveal more information.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
                <div>The most satisfying part of the interaction for me would be the different movements. By using this 
                    movement, i got triggered and curious to exploire the site more and more. This excitement it creates 
                    is I think really important to keep visitors engaged and easen the interaction. 

                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>

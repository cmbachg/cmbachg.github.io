    <h1>Responsive Units Examples</h1>

    <p>
      As on the CSS Worksheet div elements have a display of block. This means by default they'll
      take up the full width of whatever element they are inside of and the full height of whatever 
      content they have inside of them. There are three divs below but only the first two are visible - 
      the first one has something in it - text - so it has the height of the text. The second one has 
      height declared in CSS - 1rem - so we can see it. The third div is there but because it has nothing 
      in it its height is set to 0.
    </p>

    <div id="res-ex-one">I've got text in me so my height is set to the text</div>
    <div id="res-ex-two"></div>
    <div id="res-ex-three"></div>

    <p>
      When we set explicit height and width to our elements we want to use responsive units - like rem in 
      the example above. The first div below uses absolute units - 600px - so if I resize my screen it'll stay 
      the same width. The second has a responsive unit - 60% - so it takes up 60% of its parent's width. As 
      its parent is the body that essentially means 60% of the page width. The third uses rem, a unit based 
      on the default font size, so instead of responding to the size of the window it responds to the size of 
      the devices text - this is usually set to 16px but can be changed by the users system.
    </p>

    <div id="res-ex-four"></div>
    <div id="res-ex-five"></div>
    <div id="res-ex-six"></div>

    <p>
      Remeber when using % that it works on nested elements referentially. Each of the three divs below have a 
      width of 60% but each are incrementally smaller. If we instead want to refer to the size of the window 
      inside of the nested element we can use something like vh or vw. 
    </p>

    <div id="res-ex-seven">
      <div id="res-ex-eight">
        <div id="res-ex-nine"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
